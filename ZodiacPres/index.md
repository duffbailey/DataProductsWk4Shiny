## Application Summary

This application returns the zodiac sign for any person based on the month and day of their birth.

Use the sliders to set the month number (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.) and the day of the month.  The appropriate sun sign will be displayed as output.

Birth dates are based on the Gregorian calendar.  Illogical month/day combinations such as 02/31 return the zodiac sign for their logical equivalent: (03/03).

For millenia, astrologists have linked people's personality and fates to their zodiac signs. While there are many instances where this linkage appears valid, there has never been any scientific evidence supporting causality between astrology and real life events.  Consequently, this application should be used for entertainment purposes only and, under no circumstances, should it be used to assist with important life decisions.
